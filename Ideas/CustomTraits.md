Extra Experienced - character gets 50% less experience and 7 addditional custom character points (inversion of Super Studious).

Veteran - gets no experience at all, because character already is as good as can be, but trait gives really big CCP bonus - maybe 20 points. Or may be more, because no level ups means no additional traits and no free healing after level-up.

Colorblind! The color of all lazers will always be yellow, no matter what they do. This makes it riskier to go through lazers, because you never know. Other NPCs still do, however.
